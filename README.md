# AI Mock Interview App

An AI-powered mock interview platform designed to help users practice and prepare for interviews with real-time feedback. The app uses **Clerk.js** for authentication, **Dribble** for UI design, **Neon PostgreSQL** for database management, and **Gemini AI** for simulating interviews.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure login and registration using Clerk.js.
- **AI-Powered Interview Simulation**: Powered by Gemini AI to simulate mock interviews.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Instant feedback on answers provided during the mock interview.
- **Database**: User data and interview records are stored securely in a Neon PostgreSQL database.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive and responsive UI built using Dribble components.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Dribble (UI design), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Authentication**: Clerk.js
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL
- **AI**: Gemini AI for generating and simulating interview scenarios
